# Voice Music Discrimination script

The Music Speech Discrimination script is a powerful Python application
that leverages machine-learning techniques to discriminate between music and
speech audio files. This script enables users to automatically classify audio files
into two distinct categories based on their content. The accurate classification of
audio files as either music or speech is a fundamental task in various
applications such as music recommendation systems, speech recognition, and
content analysis.

## File structure
In order to test this script, you have to structure your dataset in two separate folders. One for "music" and one for"speech"
